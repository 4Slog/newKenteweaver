# Kente Code Weaver - Localization Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up and use the localization system in the Kente Code Weaver application.

## Files Created

1. **ARB Files**:
   - `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` - English translations (already existed)
   - `lib/l10n/app_fr.arb` - French translations (newly created)
   - `lib/l10n/app_tw.arb` - Twi translations (newly created)
   - `lib/l10n/app_ha.arb` - Hausa translations (newly created)

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - `l10n.yaml` - Configuration for the Flutter localization system
   - Updated `pubspec.yaml` with `generate: true` flag

3. **Translation Requirements Document**:
   - `translation_requirements.md` - Comprehensive list of all text strings in the app that require translation

## Next Steps

The localization setup has been completed with the following steps:

### 1. Generated Localization Files

We've created a custom script to generate the localization files:

```bash
dart generate_localizations.dart
```

This script generates the necessary Dart files for localization based on the ARB files in the `lib/l10n` directory. The generated files are stored in the `lib/l10n/generated` directory.

### 2. Created Localization Classes

We've created the following files to support localization:

1. **`lib/l10n/messages.dart`** - Defines the messages that will be translated
2. **`lib/l10n/app_localizations_delegate.dart`** - Implements the LocalizationsDelegate for our AppLocalizations class
3. **`lib/l10n/generated/`** - Contains the generated localization files

### 3. Updated App Configuration

We've updated the following files to use our localization system:

1. **`lib/services/localization_service.dart`** - Added our AppLocalizationsDelegate to the list of delegates
2. **`lib/app.dart`** - Imported our messages.dart file

### 4. Using Localized Strings in the App

To use the localized strings in your app, use the `AppLocalizations.of(context)` method:

```dart
// Before
Text('Welcome to Kente Code Weaver!'),

// After
Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.welcomeMessage),
```

Alternatively, you can continue using the existing `LocalizationService` for now:

```dart
// Using LocalizationService
Text(LocalizationService.getTranslatedText('welcome_message', locale)),
```

### 5. Expanding the ARB Files

The current ARB files contain only a basic set of strings. To fully localize the app, you should:

1. Expand the English ARB file (`app_en.arb`) to include all strings from the `translation_requirements.md` document
2. Update the other language ARB files with translations for all strings

### 6. Updating the LocalizationService

The app currently uses a custom `LocalizationService` with hardcoded translations. Once the Flutter localization system is fully implemented, you may want to refactor this service to use the generated `AppLocalizations` class instead.

## Notes on Translation Quality

For the best translation quality, especially for languages like Twi and Hausa:

1. Work with native speakers to review and improve the translations
2. Consider using professional translation services
3. Pay special attention to technical terms and cultural context

## Testing Localization

To test the localization:

1. Change the language in the app settings
2. Verify that all UI elements are correctly translated
3. Test text-to-speech functionality with different languages
4. Check that dynamic content (stories, tutorials) is properly translated
