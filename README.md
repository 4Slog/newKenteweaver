# Kente Weaver - Enhanced Features

This project implements enhanced features for the Kente Weaver application, focusing on UI/UX improvements, pattern visualization, and pattern sharing capabilities.

## Features

### Pattern Visualization

The Pattern Visualization feature provides multiple ways to view and understand Kente patterns:

- **Standard View**: Basic pattern display
- **Color-Coded View**: Highlights different colors and their cultural meanings
- **Block Highlight View**: Shows execution order of blocks
- **Concept Highlight View**: Maps blocks to coding concepts
- **Cultural Context View**: Shows cultural elements and symbols
- **3D Visualization**: Displays the pattern in three dimensions

### UI Enhancements

The UI Enhancement features provide a more engaging and accessible experience:

- **Customizable Themes**: Theme mode (light/dark/system), primary and accent colors
- **Accessibility Options**: Reduce motion, high contrast mode, text scaling
- **Enhanced UI Components**: Buttons, cards, text fields, and list items with animations
- **Animation Settings**: Adjustable animation speed
- **Contextual Help**: Tooltips and guidance

### Pattern Sharing

The Pattern Sharing feature allows users to share their patterns with others:

- **Multiple Sharing Methods**:
  - Share via link
  - Share via email
  - Share via QR code
  - Share via social media
  - Export as file
- **Sharing Settings**:
  - Include metadata (creator, creation date)
  - Include comments
  - Include version history
  - Enable collaboration
- **Sharing History**: Track and manage previous shares

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a service-oriented architecture with the following key components:

- **Services**:
  - `PatternVisualizationService`: Handles enhanced pattern visualization
  - `UIEnhancementService`: Provides UI enhancement features
  - `PatternSharingService`: Manages pattern sharing functionality

- **Widgets**:
  - `PatternVisualizationWidget`: Displays patterns with various visualization modes
  - `EnhancedUIShowcase`: Demonstrates UI enhancement features
  - `PatternSharingWidget`: Interface for sharing patterns

- **Screens**:
  - `EnhancedFeaturesScreen`: Combines all enhanced features in a tabbed interface
